You can use the sidebar to navigate through the web app.

Here are the different views and their descriptions:

2. Peer Eval: This is where you can evaluate your teammates weekly (Note: all the input fields are pre-filled with the maximum values - you may or may not choose to change them)! You can submit more than one evaluation until the deadline.
